# Quantum Classification using ANNs
This is my final project for the Quantum Information exam at Unipd. It aims at developing machine learning algorithms for Quantum Physics Models.

In the Example section, I briefly review a few typical machine learning tasks (text and image classification) and their solution via Neural Networks implemented in Keras. The scripts in this section are adapted from the tutorials of the [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/#examples) libraries.

Finally, I use the Neural Networks to solve two classification problems in the Quantum domain, namely the distinction between phases in the Ising model and the separability testing of Quantum states.
